/*
 Alice has learnt factorization recently. Bob doesn't think she has learnt it properly and hence
 he has decided to quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large number and asks her to find out the number 
 of factors of that number. To make it a little easier for her, he represents the number as a 
 product of N numbers. Alice is frightened of big numbers and hence is asking you for help. Your 
 task is simple. Given N numbers, you need to tell the number of distinct factors of the product of 
 these N numbers.
