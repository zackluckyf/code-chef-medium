/*
 n Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.
 Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4. But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).
 You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.
 You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for it?
