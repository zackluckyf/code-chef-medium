 Mike likes strings. He is also interested in algorithms. A few days ago he discovered for himself a 
 very nice problem: You are given an AB-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, 
 which have an equal number of 'A'-s and 'B'-s. Do you know how to solve it? Good.
 Mike will make the problem a little bit more difficult for you. You are given an ABC-string S. You
 need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of 'A'-s, 'B'-s and 'C'-s.
 A string is called AB-string if it doesn't contain any symbols except 'A' or 'B'. A string is 
 called ABC-string if it doesn't contain any symbols except 'A', 'B' or 'C'.
